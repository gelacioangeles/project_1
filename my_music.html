    <h2>What is Zero?</h2>
    <p>Zero is my artist name. I use it whenever I am working on music. I have been creating and performing music for around 8-9 years now. The type of music I create is in the genre of Deathmetal, but I also do variations of metal or even different genres.</p>
    <h2>My Path Into Creating Music</h2>
    <p>I started playing guitar at a very young age. Over the years, I've also learned other instruments along the way, such as bass, drums, piano, and even vocals.</p>
